228 life histories of cascadia butterflies  family nymphalidae subfamily heliconiinae  fritillaries  sixteen species of fritillaries occur in cascadia, including 9 greater fritillaries {argynnis), 6 lesser fritillaries (boloria), and euptoicta claiidia
  all fritillaries are orange dorsally with complex markings of black lines and  spots
 ventrally, greater fritillaries bear large oval spots (silvered or not) on  the hindwings, and lesser fritillaries have violet- or rust-tinted hindwings  with white or yellow non-oval spots or markings, and euploicla has drab banded markings
  greater fritillaries are found in all montane habitats and many moist lowland habitats
 they are single brooded with long-lived adults; females of most species enter reproductive diapause and aestivate in midsummer
 males eclose before females, and eggs are laid singly in late summer and early fall near or on dried remnants of violets
 lesser fritillaries (except b. sclenc) also have a single generation, most are restricted to mid-high elevations, and adults do not aestivate
  fritillary eggs are conical to barrel-shaped with strong vertical ribs, white-yellow maturing to orange or red. tlie greater fritillaries overwinter as unfed first-instar larvae and develop during spring, passing through 6 instars
 the larvae are generally gray-black, adorned with branched spines, some with a lighter dorsal stripe and many with orange spine bases
 pupae are brown and hang vertically from a cremaster
  lesser and greater fritillaries have similar eggs; the larvae are also similar, although those of lesser fritillaries are smaller, sometimes with subtle  spotting and black or orange spine bases
 all boloria have 5 instars, 4 species overwintering as partly grown larvae and 1 as an unfed first instar
 boloria  astarte is biennial, overwintering twice
 larval hosts include violets, bilberry, kinnikinnick, saxifrage, bistort, and willow
 the pupae are similar to those of argynnis but vary in darkness and girth, and 3 have spiny abdominal processes and pearly nodes
  most fritillary larvae are active nocturnally
 all possess an eversible ventral gland on the first segment that emits chemicals likely used in defense against predators
  subfamily heliconiinae \ family nymphalidae 229   mi -    230 i life histories of cascadia butterflies subfamily heliconiinae | family nymphalidae 231  i  variegated fritillary euptoieta claudia (cramer)  adult biology euptoieta claudia is a primarily tropical species intermediate between argynnis and heliconius
 in  the us it is a permanent resident from s az e to nc, flying all year with multiple generations (scott, 1986a). highly migratory and opportunistic, e. claudia ranges far to the n in summer, reaching se bc and across canada to the atlantic
 unable to withstand freezing,  n populations die out each fall, although a population has survived in quebec for at least 10 years (layberry et al., 1998). this species has not been found in wa or or but has been reported in bc close to the ne vva border, and there are records from the id panhandle
 during invasive years e. claudia reaches its n limits in late summer; records in bc occur from july 17-sep 4 (guppy and shepard, 2001). in its breeding range the preferred habitat includes open sunny fields, prairies, and roadsides (tveten and tveten, 1996), but it can be found everywhere but deep forests (pyle, 1981). larvae feed on a wide variety of host plants, including viola (violet), linum (flax), plantago (plantain), desmodiuni spp. (beggarticks), portulaca spp. (purslane), and passiflora (passion vine). males patrol all day just above the ground for mates; a receptive female holds her wings mostly closed and abdomen raised slightly
 the male lands behind and flutters his wings, then mating occurs (scott, 1986a). eggs are laid singly on stems and leaves of the host
  immature stage biology we reared this species once, from eggs from a female collected w of golden, jefferson co., co. after  12 days caged with viola glabella (stream violet), plantago major (common plantain), and passiflora incarnate (purple passionflower), she laid 58 eggs on the paper cage liner
 the eggs hatched in 3 days, and li were placed on the above hosts plus sedum lanceolatum (lanceleaf stonecrop). the larvae fed only on v. glabella, which was replaced with v. adunca for the remainder of the rearing
 fewer than half  the eggs hatched, and 9 survived to l2, but survival thereafter was 100(i. 1.1 consumed eggshells and were reared at 20-22 c, initially in petri dishes with cut leaves
 early instars avoided leaf edges, grazing the midleaf surface halfway through in irregular patches, breaking through in places, leaving translucent windows elsewhere
 from l3, larvae consumed whole  leaves, producing large jagged holes from the middle or edges
 the rate of development was staggered; some reached 1,3 while others were still li. in l3 and l4,  larvae mostly rested on the underside of leaves during the day, feeding nocturnally
 by late l4 and 1,5, larvae often wandered off the host, seeking sunny spots for basking, returning to feed mostly nocturnally
 at this stage entire leaves were consumed, leaving only the stems
 when 1.5 reached -40 mm, feeding ceased, wandering increased, and pupation occurred at the top of the cage
 ttie time from egg-hatch to pupation was 19-27 days and adults ectosed 9 days later
 tliere are 5 instars and no nests are constructed
 mature  larvae make little attempt at concealment and may be aposematic, although they are eaten by birds (allen et al., 2005). early instars derive protection from setal droplets (li), concealment, and nocturnal feeding, and later instars possess spines, intimidatory anterior horns, and a large black ventral gland that may emit defensive chemicals
 iveten and tveten (1996) reported that adults overwinter in 1x, perhaps in reproductive diapause (gech and tudor, 2005).  description of immature stages the egg is a white, strongly tapered cone with 14 strong vertical rilts that merge to -9 at the apex around the micropyle
 1,1 has a shiny black abdomen tip and bifurcated head, and the body is white infused with considerable yellow laterally and dorsally
 each segment has -8 black bullae, each sporting a long black droplet-tipped seta
 l2 is brown, and there are white dorsolateral and ventrolateral stripes
 the bullae are tall black conical spines, each with multiple black setae; the anterior-most pair constitute forward-projecting black conical horns
 tlie head is shiny black, remaining so until pupation
 l3 is similar, but the ground color is orange and the horns are proportionally longer
 tlie 2 white stripes are strongly developed and divided vertically into 3-5 pieces per segment
 tire spines and setae are shiny black, remaining so to pupation
 1,4 is brighter orange; the white longitudinal stripes are bold and edged in black
 tlie anterior horns are twice as long as other spines and there is a sc]uarish black spot between them
 1,5 is similar, the anterior horns -3 times longer than  t egg 0.8 mm  pupa @17 mm (lateral, left, dorsal, right)  other spines
 true legs and prologs are shinv black
 the pupa is ornate, initially bright orange dorsallv, maturing to white with black spots and metallic-  gold conical spines in lateral and dorsolateral rows
 the wing cases are white with strongly contrasting black spots and oblong markings
 the larva of e. claudia is unique in cascadia and should not be confused with any other species, although the pupa resembles those of euphvilryas spp. published images include mature larvae in t\ eten and t veten (1996), allen et al. (2005), and minno et al. (2005), and mature larvae and pupae in p\te (1981), scott (1986a), allen (1997), and wagner (2t)05). all images agree with ours, although it. larvae have orange heads with black markings (minno et al., 2005).  discussion  this species is easily reared, proc-ided eggs are obtained in sufficient numbers to accommodate high egg and li mortality
 adults should be sought in far ne wa, where they will likely eventualh- be found
 why and how 1 population persists in quebec city, 1,000 miles north of its normal overwintering range, would make a fascinating research project
 tj-ie benefits derived from great summer range expansion each year followed by invariable winter contraction are unclear and would make an interesting study
 tlie possible aposematism of mature larvae and possible defensive function of the 1.1 setal droplets and ventral gland would provide excellent chemical ecology research subjects

 beyond cascadia the range includes most of s canada and n us. preferring moist woods, meadows, and riparian areas, a. cybele is widely distributed, occurring from sea level to 6,000 ft (warren, 2005). the single brood flies early june-early oct. larval hosts include viola glabella (stream violet), v. adunca (blue violet), v. niittallii  (nuttall's violet), and v. sempervirens (evergreen violet). males eclose 4-5 days before females (james, 2008a), although allen (1997) reported their appearance 2-3 weeks before females in e us. females mate, enter reproductive diapause, and aestivate for 3-5 weeks after eclosion (james, 2008a), and are rarely seen before aug. flight is strong, and males patrol for females often in a territorial circuit (douglas and douglas, 2005). both sexes nectar on thistles, milkweed, and dogbane
 populations may be sedentary (miller and hammond, 2007). in aug and sep females lay eggs singly and haphazardly near the bases of dead and dying viola spp. (scott, 1986a; douglas and douglas, 2005).  immature stage biology we reared this species 3 times from gravid females collected mid-late aug in kittitas and asotin cos., wa. eggs hatched in 10-12 days at 20-22 c, then the larvae congregated under cover and diapaused as unfed li. overwintering for -80 days at 5 c was sufficient for li to break diapause and begin feeding on v. adunca leaves within -4 days at 25 c (james, 2008a). development from postdiapause li to pupation took an average of 44 days, females ~ 1 week longer than males, and adults edosed 13-19 days after pupation (james, 2008a). larvae feed  nocturnally, seeking cover during the day under leaves, rocks, or debris
 violet leaves are eaten from  the edges, producing large scooped-out holes
 larvae do not make nests
 postdiapause larvae are solitary but tolerate each other well in captivity
 l2 and older larvae possess a ventral gland on segment 1 that everts if the larva is threatened, emitting a musky odor, likely for defense (james, 2008a). larvae hearing pupation silk a number of leaves together to form a pupation tent, often very close to and sometimes touching the ground
 pupae are noticeably more wriggly than other argynnis spp. protection is based on nocturnal feeding, spines, possible chemical protection, and camolillage
 i here are 6 instars
  description of immature stages the pale yellow egg matures to pinkish red with darker spots, and is truncated conical
 it bears -20 strong vertical ribs that merge to 9-10 at the top. li is reddish brown or grayish, with 8 distinct black bullae in a transverse row across each segment; each bulla has a long brown seta with a droplet at the tip. tliere is a gray dorsal stripe that persists through l3. l2 is gray with black longitudinal lines along the spine bases
 the bullae are tall conical black spines bearing 10-12 black setae
 1.3 is similar with black lines along the spine rows, except for the ventral spines, which have bright orange bases
 l3ull cream and orange patches appear at the ba.ses of other spines
 1.4 is similar but is darker and has more distinct orange bases to lateral  spines
 the head has paired dorsal orange-brown patches
 1.5 is dark gray-black with no dorsal stripe but indistinct dark lines laterally
 tlie black spines have large bright orange bases and the orange-brown head patches merge dorsally
 in some populations the dorsal spines lack orange bases
 1.6 is jet black with an orange head dorsally
 paired spines on segment 1 point forward over the head, which is black on the face
 spines are pale to bright orange with black tips, or all black in the 2 dorsal rows
 true legs are black, prolegs brown
 tlie pupa is shiny dark brown, and the wing cases are slightly lighter with black vein lines
 the shape is robust, swollen in tbe middle with a large girth, and the abdomen bas parallel rows of orange bullae
 immature stages of this species are similar to those of other argynnis spp., especially a. cglcis, a. hydaspe, and a. hespcris, all of which have dark larvae
 argynnis cybele differs by having oranger spines and lacking a dorsal stripe

  discussion additional information on immature stages is available in james (2008a). i.arvae are ditlicult to find, but eggs are readily obtained tvom gravid females
 one wandering larva we tound was parasitized
 douglas and douglas (2005) captured larvae in pitfall traps placed at the bases of host plants showing leaf damage
 larvae are easily reared on violet leaves, with native species preferred; late- instar a. cybele fed poorly on pansy (james, 2008a). research is being conducted on the chemistry and defensive function of the ventral osmeterium- like gland (james, 2008a), and similar studies are needed for the droplets on i.l setae

 males remain largely at low elevations
 populations seen migrating upslope near rimrock lk, yakima co., wa (3,000 ft) on june 4 were entirely female; they spend june-aug at high elevations (5,000-8,000 ft) seeking nectar
 reproductive diapause in females terminates by early aug in wa (james, 2008a), and they move downslope seeking host violets at lower elevations
 this altitudinal migration is most marked in the e cascades and yakima valley of wa. larval hosts are viola trinervata (sagebrush violet), v. beckwithii (great basin violet), v nuttallii (nuttall's violet), v. praemorsa (prairie violet), v. purpurea (goosefoot violet), and v douglasii (douglas' violet) (scott, 1986a; pyle, 2002). eggs are laid singly on or near senesced violets in late aug-oct.  immature stage biology we reared or partially reared this species several times
 gravid females obtained from yakima co., wa from july 30 to sep 29 over 4 years produced 100- 1,000 eggs per cohort, 2-5% of which were reared to  adults
 oviposition occurred in partial sunlight at 21- 35 c on dried leaves and stems of viola labradorica  (labrador violet). no oviposition occurred on live  violets
 females obtained on july 30 took 7 days to oviposit; later-caught females oviposited within 2 days of caging
 eggs hatched in 14-20 days, and li sought refuge in curled leaves and dried seedpods without feeding
 li were overwintered at 4-5 c for 10-20 weeks before e.xposure to 25-27 c and constant light
 short daylengths (12 hr) failed to break dormancy despite warm temperatures
 postdiapause li took 3-5 days to commence feeding on viola adiinca (blue violet) and viola glabclla (stream violet). li molted to l2 after 8-9 days, and development from l2 to pupation took 31 days, with a further 12 days before adult eclosion
 postdiapause larvae preferentially feed on flowers and young leaves at first, then leaves only, eating holes from the edges
 larvae are solitary with no nests, but tolerate high densities well in captivity
 most feeding is nocturnal, with larvae often resting under leaves during the day. l2-l6 possess an eversible, ventral gland that produces a musky odor when the larva is disturbed (james, 2008a) and is likely defensive
 mature larvae often silk together leaves as pupation tents, and pupation always occurs close to the ground
 larval defense is based on concealment (nocturnal feeding, pupa), chemical protection (ventral gland, setal droplets in li), and spines
  description of immature stages the egg is conical, white, developing red spots and dashes with maturity, becoming dark before hatching
 there are 20-22 prominent vertical ribs terminating around a well-defined micropyle
 li is cream or  yellowish orange with a shiny black setaceous head and 8 dark bullae on each segment; each bulla sports a long seta with a droplet at the tip. postdiapause li develop a reddish tinge
 l2 is blackish gray with an indistinct middorsal dark stripe and tall conical black spines sporting -10 setae
 bullae in the midlateral row on segments 4-11 have orange bases
 l3 is mostly black with 2 intermittent middorsal white stripes
 l4 is similar but grayer with distinct orange-based spines laterally and a prominent middorsal pair of white stripes
 tire head is shiny black
 l5 is darker, mottled with white and gray especially laterally, and the midlateral spines become orange
 l6 is similar; white markings on the body, including the dorsal stripes, are larger and more distinct, giving the larva an overall grayish appearance
 tire head is black with no orange markings
 'llie pupa is medium brown with dark brown-black markings, including segment joints
 most argynnis spp. are similar, but a. h. brico, a. h. dodgei, a. cgleis, a. cybclc, and a. liydaspc larvae are darker

 similarly, viola tricolor (pansy) was accepted only by 1.5-1.6. the w native violets v. adunca and v. glabclla were very acceptable hosts
 the reproductive ecology of this species l6 @ 35 mm with well-defined adult and larval diapauses deserves further study

 mating occurs immediately after female eclosion (guppy and shepard, 2001), and females do not mature their ovaries for 3-5 weeks (sims, 1984; scott, 1986a), spending the summer at higher elevations, returning to areas with violets to oviposit in aug and sep. reproductive diapause in females terminates by early aug in wa (james, 2008a). oviposition occurs on senesced violets; pyle (2002) suggested that females hunt over turf for violet scent
  immature stage biology we reared this species 5 times
 gravid females from kittitas, columbia, and pend oreille cos., wa during aug over 5 years produced 100-1,000 eggs per cohort, 2-5% of which were reared to adults
 oviposition occurred in a variety of enclosures with fresh or dried violets, in partial sunlight at temperatures of 20-35 c. eggs hatched in 13-19 days according to temperature
  and li overwintered (at 4-5 c) in clusters among leaf debris without feeding
 postdiapause li took 5 days at 25 c to commence feeding
 development from l2 to pupation took 45 days at 20-22 c on v nuttallii and 34 days at 25 c on v adiinca
 l5 and 1.6 also fed well on v. labradorica (labrador violet) and v. tricolor (pansy). adults eclosed 13-21 days after pupation
 larvae initially fed on flowers and leaves, then leaves only, eating holes from the edges
 larvae are solitary with no nests, but tolerate siblings in captivity

 scott (1986a) and  jatnes (2008a) reported that silked-together leaves are often used as pupation tents
 larval defense is based on concealment (nocturnal feeding), chemical protection (ventral gland, setal droplets?), and physical protection (spines).  description of immature stages itie egg is white, narrowed, and truncated at the top.

 beyond cascadia it ranges over much of w north america from s bc to the prairie provinces, s to co and ca. preferred habitats include montane canyons, open moist  wooded areas, and shrub-steppe prairie at elevations of 300-9,700 ft. the flight period is protracted in s bc and wa, females entering reproductive diapause soon after eclosion, moving to high elevations during june- july before returning to lay eggs in mid-late aug (guppy and shepard, 2001). scott (1992) suggested that a. callippe undergoes little or no reproductive diapause in co, dying before late summer, which also appears to be the case for populations in n ca (shapiro and manolis, 2007). larval hosts confirmed in cascadia are viola nuttallii (nuttall's violet) and  viola sempervirens (evergreen violet), although other viola spp. are likely used as well
 males frequent hilltops as well as patrolling hillsides near the ground to seek females (scott, 1986a). both sexes visit thistles and mints, and males are avid puddlers
 females crawl  into shady hollows where they lay eggs singly, often in litter where no violets are apparent but are present in spring (scott, 1986a, 1992).  immature stage biology we reared this species several times from gravid females
 a female collected june 29 in yakima co.,  wa, lived for 6 weeks but did not lay eggs until early aug. larvae died during overwintering
 females collected july 24 (yakima co.), july 24, july 26 (different years) (kittitas co., wa), produced -150, icq, and icq eggs, respectively
 eggs hatched after -11 days
 li sought refuge and were overwintered at 4-5 c from late aug. winter survival was poor if  h  relative humidity was <70')o. after -100 days, 30 li were exposed to 26 c and continuous light
 feeding on viola labradorica (labrador violet) commenced  after 3 days witb 1.2 reached 7 days later

 one  individual reached 1.6 before dying in april
 on april 18, 2 li were exposed to the same conditions and reared on v. nuttallii
 ijiese grew faster, pupating 34 days after first feeding, adults eclosing after a further 13 days
 li fed on violet petals or leaves
 later instars ate only leaves, feeding nocturnally and eating holes from the leaf edges
 at maturity the larvae wandered off the host plant to pupate close to the ground under lightly silked leaf tents
 there are 6 instars and no nests are constructed
 protection is based on nocturnal  feeding, spines, and likely cbemical protection from a ventral gland on segment 1 (l2-l6) and setal droplets in li.  description of immature stages the egg is pale yellow, ovate at the base, narrowed and truncated at the top. there are 20-26 strong vertical ribs

 it is sparsely distributed in wa but more readily found in the wallowa-blues, ochocos, warners and siskiyou ranges of or. adults fly in 1 generation mid-june-early sep and can be locally common
 males emerge a week or two before females, patrol and sometimes hill-top. no evidence has been presented that females enter reproductive diapause; this strategy may be unnecessary in these higher- elevation habitats
 later in the flight period females are found mostly in wooded areas seeking host plants
 both sexes are avid flower visitors on mountain balm,  thistles, asters, yarrow, and rabbitbrush; males visit mud. recorded host plants are viola nuttalli (nuttall's violet), v. praemorsa (prairie violet), v. adunca (blue violet), v. purpurea (goosefoot violet), and v. walteri (prostrate blue violet) (scott, 1986a; pyle, 2002). eggs are laid singly on or near senescing violets
  immature stage biology we reared this species twice, obtaining eggs from 4-7 gravid females collected near mt misery, garfield co., wa on aug 3 and 14 (different years). females were caged with potted viola labradorica (labrador violet) and 50-100 eggs were laid over 2 weeks
 initially (48 hrs) eggs were laid on the living plant, thereafter on inert surfaces and senesced leaves and stems
 eggs hatched after 15 days at 21-23 g, and unfed li sought refuge in curled leaves and dried seedpods
 li were held at 20-25 c until early oct then transferred to an unheated garage
 one month later they were transferred to 5 c for overwintering
 after 61, 69, 77, and 133 days, 9, 3, 12, and 22 li were transferred to summer-like rearing conditions, 25 c, constant illumination
 li in the first 2 cohorts took 10-12 days  to commence feeding on v adtinca-, the later cohorts took 48 hrs. l2 was reached 8 days after transfer, and development from l2 to pupation took 34 days with a further 12 days to eclosion
 all instars fed on k adunca, v. labradorica, and \'. glahella (stream violet). postdiapause larvae fed on young leaves at first, then older leaves, eating holes from the edges
 l6 accepted viola tricolor (pansy) as a host, but li were unable to feed on this plant
 viola trincrvata (sagebrush violet) was refused by l3. larvae are solitary with no nests but tolerate high densities well in captivity
 most feeding is nocturnal, with larvae resting under leaves during the day. 1.2-1.6 possess an eversible, ventral gland on segment 1 that produces a musky odor when the larva is disturbed (james, 2008a) and  is likely defensive
 mature larvae silk together leaves as pupation tents close to the ground in limited space
 many pupae fall to the ground
 larval defense is based on concealment (nocturnal feeding, pupa), chemical protection (ventral gland, setal droplets in li), and physical protection (spines).  description of immature stages the egg is white and conical with 24-26 prominent vertical ribs merging to -15 at the top. li is reddish brown, paler laterally, with a shiny black setaceous head and 8-10 prominent black bullae across each segment
 each bulla sports a long dark seta with a droplet at the tip. l2 is dark brown with a wide middorsal pale stripe and a thin central dark stripe
 there are 6 prominent conical black spines across each segment, each bearing -10 setae
 lateral spines on segments 4-12 have vaguely orange bases
 l3 is blackish with larger spines bearing more setae and distinct orange bases to lateral spines on segments 4-12. l4 is black mottled with white, creating a grayish appearance
 the orange-based lateral spines are distinct, and 2 parallel dorsal white stripes are separated by a tbin black stripe
 l5 is similar, darker with brown head markings dorsally and laterally, distinct orange-based lateral spines, and indistinct orange bases to the other spines
 dorsally, white markings on each segment are concentrated posteriorly
 1.6 is black mottled with brown and has 2 indistinct thin white lines dorsally
 spines in the lateral row are whitish yellow, as are bases of the dorsolateral black spines
 the black head is like that of  1.5 and the spiracles are black
 the pupa is brown with black markings limited to intersegmental banding, the eyes, and wing venation
 there are 2-3 lateral rows of indistinct orange spots on the abdomen

 overwintering li require at least 60-70% humidity and must experience -2.3 months of cold temperatures before being able to commence feeding when exposed to warm temperatures
 three previously unreported violet hosts were accepted by all instars, and pansies were acceptable to final instars

 in se wa and or a. h. dodgei is found in cool, forested and open, dry subalpine habitats (1,500- 8,000 ft) and can be locally common (dornfield, 1980; warren, 2005; miller and hammond, 2007).  the single brood flies mid-june-sep, males emerging a week or so before females
 males patrol meadows, hillsides, and ridgelines and visit mud and animal scat
 both sexes feed at flowers, particularly mountain balm, thistles, asters, and yarrow
 larval hosts are violets, with viola pupurea (coosefoot violet), v. adunca (blue violet), v. nuttallii (nuttall's violet), and  v. praemorsa (prairie violet) confirmed (scott et al., 1998; warren, 2005). eggs are laid singly on or near senescing violets
  immature stage biology we reared this species 3 times from gravid females obtained on aug 14 near mt misery, carfield co., wa and aug 20 and aug 21 near mt howard, wallowa co., or. confined with dried foliage of viola labradorica (labrador violet) in a plastic container with a muslin lid (32 x 20 x 9 cm) and held at 23-26 c in dappled sunlight, females laid 15, 50, and 65 eggs, respectively, during 3-7 days
 eggs hatched after 12-13 days, and li sought refuge in curled leaves and dried seedpods without feeding
 li were held at 20-25 c until  mid-sep, then transferred to 5 c for overwintering
 after 92-107 days, 1,1 were placed on v adunca, v. labradorica (labrador violet), or vi odorata (sweet  violet) leaflets at 27 c with continuous lighting
 feeding commenced after 4 days, and 1.2 was reached 2 days later
 development from 1.2 to pupation took 30-40 days, with adults eclosing 19-28 days later (pupae held at 19-21 c). 1.1-1.5 fed well on the 3 viola spp. provided
 postdiapause larvae fed on young leaves at first, then older leaves, eating holes from the edges
 larvae arc solitary with no nests and most feeding is nocturnal, with larvae resting under leaves during the day. l2-l6 possess an eversible ventral gland that produces a musky odor when the larva is disturbed (james, 2008a) and likely defensive
 mature larvae silk together leaves as pupation tents, and pupation occurs close to the ground in limited space
 larval defense is based on concealment (nocturnal  feeding, pupa), chemical protection (ventral gland, setal droplets in l!), and physical protection (.spines).  description of immature stages the egg is creamy white, developing distinctive reddish brown lines and spots
 there are 22-23 prominent vertical ribs merging to -15 at the top. li is medium- dark brown, paler laterally with a shiny black setaceous head and 8-10 black bullae across each segment

 tlie black head has few or no brown markings
 4he pupa is mostly black dorsally with mahogany brown wing cases marked in black primarily following venation
 most argynnis spp. larvae are similar but lighter in color, argynnis hydaspe, a. egleis, a. cybelc, and a. h. brico have dark larvae, but a. egleis and a. h. brico have a pair of dorsal white lines, and a. cybcle has vivid orange spines

  discussion  the substantial difference between a. hesperis (both subspecies) and a. atlantis larvae, first reported by scott (1988) and scott et al. (1998) and illustrated here, supports the specific status of these 2 entities
 additional studies on the biology of immature stages of these species should be conducted and may reveal further differences
 cravid females appear to oviposit well in captivity, as do other argynnis spp. the full host range of this species remains to be determined; viola glabella (stream violet) occurs commonly in the sh wa and ne or habitats occupied by a. h. dodgei and is a likely host
 itic identity and impact of natural enemies on population dynamics of this localized but sometimes common species are unknown and deserve study
 also worthy of study is the possible existence of reproductive diapause in newly eclosed females

 argynnis hesperis brico has affinities to the n and e and the rocky mts, while a. h. dodgei resembles relatives to the s. a single brood flies from mid-june to early sep, occupying partially wooded, moist meadow habitats, often near watercourses
 larval host plants include viola adunca (blue violet), v. canadensis  (canadian violet), v. nuttallii (nuttall's violet), and perhaps v. sempervirens (evergreen violet). males patrol meadows, ridges, and hilltops and visit mud. courtship is similar to that of other argynnis spp., females ovipositing throughout aug near senesced violets after most of the earlier-flying males have died
  it is likely, although unconfirmed, that females are in reproductive diapause from eclosion to late july, as in other argynnis spp. (james, 2008a).  immature stage biology we reared this subspecies once
 females obtained on aug 22 near tiger meadows, pend oreille co., wa produced 86 eggs
 eggs hatched after 5-18 days, and -70 li sought refuge under dead leaves and entered diapause without feeding
 larvae were overwintered at 4 c from sep 23. on may 17, larvae were exposed to 20-22 c under natural daylengths and provided with v. nuttalli and v. glabella (stream violet). the larvae rejected v. nuttallii but readily accepted v. glabella and commenced feeding within a day or  two. development from commencement of feeding to pupation was rapid, taking 22 days (june 8), and adults began eclosing -17 days later
 many larvae died in early instars, but 3 survived to l6. further mortality occurred before pupation from disease; only 3 pupated successfully anti eclosed to adults
 larvae fed nocturnally on viola leaves, eating from edges; they were solitary and did not construct nests
 camouflage coloration, nocturnal feeding activity, spines, and likely chemical protection (from a ventral gland in l2-l6 and setal droplets in 1.1) contribute to the defense of these larvae f rom natural enemies
  description of immature stages the eggs are yellow maturing to red, with -15 strong vertical ribs crossed by -20 weaker lateral ribs
 li is dark magenta with a shiny black head and -10 dark bullae per segment, each with a long dark seta
 l2 is purplish brown; tall conical spines replace bullae, each bearing several dark setae
 1.3 is darker, the spines black with bristly setae, and the black head has distinct brown dorsal patches
 1.4 is shiny black except for small orangish patches at the lateral spine bases
 l5 is similar to l4, the brown head patches prominent,  with 2 dorsolateral stripes darker than the blackish body, and a pair of thin pale dorsal stripes
 in l6 the pale dorsal stripes remain, and all spines except dorsal rows are pinkish with black tips
 the shiny pupa is rich chestnut brown with black splotches
 the eggs of a. h. brico and a. h. dodgei are generally similar, but in li a. h. brico is magenta while a. h. dodgei is more olive
 in 1.3 a. h. brico develops a pair of brown patches on the top of the black head, while in a. h. dodgei the head is often solid black
 during l4-l6 the brown markings on the head capsule of a. h. brico enlarge, while in some individuals of a. h. dodgei the head remains black throughout development
 tlie pupae of the subspecies are similar, with a. h. brico more reddish, especially on the abdomen
 larvae of a. hydaspe are similar but usually lack brown markings on the head, or if they occur they are very minor
 mature larvae of a. h. brico tend to be shiny black with brighter orange markings than those of either a. h. dodgei or a. hydaspe
 otiier argynnis spp., except a. cybele and a. eglcis, have paler larvae, the former lacking dorsal stripes and with more extensive orange spines, the latter with paler sides

 some lepidopterists still regard a. hesperis and a. atlanlis as conspecific; however, in cascadia the pale, dcrrsally striped larvae of a. atlantis bear limited resemblance to the black larvae of a. h. brico or a. h. dodgei
 further rearing of a. h. brico and a. h. dodgei populations is needed to confirm the differences we report between these subspecies
 little is known about the ecology of either subspecies, including the existence or not of reproductive diapause and the mortality factors affecting immature stages
 in our rearings, a. h. brico larvae developed faster than those of a. h. dodgei, 22 days from commencement ofpo

  immature stage biology we reared this species from females obtained on aug 14 and 28 at bunchgrass and tiger meadows, pend oreille co., wa. confined with dried viola  labradorica (labrador violet) or v. glabella (stream violet), females laid -165 eggs
 eggs hatched after 13-14 days at 21-25 c, and li sought refuge in curled leaves without feeding
 one group of li held at these temperatures and 30-40% rh suffered major mortality, with -70% desiccating within a few days
 the survivors imbibed moisture and expanded in size
 larvae were transferred to 5 c, 70-80% rh  on sep 24 for overwintering, 1 group in dead leaf refugia, the other on filter paper
 after 101 days, larvae were inspected; 100% and 48% of the dead leaf  and filter paper 1.1 survived, respectively; all were exposed to 15-24 c, 12 hr light, and provided with vi labradorica and v. adiinca (blue violet). feeding commenced after 3-5 days (only on v! labradorica), and 1.2 was reached 7-9 days later
 another cohort (n = 25) was held at 5 c for -250 days, then exposed to 20-22 c with v glabclhr, they fed sparingly, but all died by l2. in the successlul cohort, development from l2 to pupation took 35-39 days, with adults eclosing after a further 12 days (21-26 c). larvae fed readily on v. labradorica and v odorata (sweet violet), rejecting v adtinca

 the range includes nearly all of cascadia except the drier parts of the columbia basin and se or. beyond cascadia it is found from central bc to central ca,  e to co and ut. found from near sea level to 8,300  ft (warren, 2005), the single brood flies mid-may- late sep. larval host plants include viola glabella (streamviolet), v. adunca (blue violet), v. nuttallii (nuttall's violet), and v. sempervirens (evergreen violet). other violets (e.g., v. orbiculata, v. purpurea) are used elsewhere (scott, 1986a). males hill-top and are often seen at mud; both sexes visit thistles, asters,  penstemons, and dogbane
 males begin flight earlier than females, and after mating the females enter summer aestivation for 3-5 weeks before becoming gravid in early aug (james, 2008a). oviposition occurs in aug-sep in the vicinity of senesced violets
 pyle (2002) observed females ovipositing on rocks at the base of v. adunca in the olympic mts of wa.  immature stage biology we reared this species 4 times
 on aug 1,3, 10, and 30 (different years) gravid females were obtained from yakima, kittitas, and garfield cos., wa, and  grant co., or, respectively
 on each occasion large numbers of eggs (-100-500) were laid on dried v. glabella and v. labradorica (labrador violet) leaves and stems and inert surfaces (paper, cage sides, etc.). the yakima co. cohort oviposited only on potted v. labradorica during the first 2 days, ignoring dried foliage
 eggs hatched in -9 days at 25 c; li partially  consumed eggshells, sought refuge under leaves and debris, and became dormant
 li were overwintered at  4-5 c from late sep/early oct. survival of li during overwintering varied with relative humidity; high mortality occurred at 6()-7()o rh, low mortality at 80-90% rh. larvae were exposed to warm (20-26 c) temperatures and continuous light or natural daylengths after 90-180 days and reared on v mittalli, v. adunca, v. glabella, or v labradorica
 development from start of feeding to pupation took 30-35 days, with adults eclosing after a further 12 days
 this is significantly faster than the rates recorded for a. coronis, a. zercnc, a. cglcis, and a. cybele (james, 2008). feeding by li was initially on flowers or small leaves, the earliest feeding causing windowpanes in leaves
 l2-l6 fed on larger leaves, eating from the edges
 i.arvae fed well on all violets except v labradorica when provided with alternative hosts; however, l4-l6 in a no-choice test with v. labradorica developed to adulthood
 no nests are made and larvae are nocturnal, retreating into refugia during the day. there are 6 instars and protection is based on diurnal concealment, chemical protection (ventral gland on segment 1, setal droplets in 1.1), and spines
  description of immature stages the egg is yellowish while turning purplish red, with -20 strong vertical ribs merging to -12 around the micropyle
 li is reddish brown with a transverse row of 8 black bullae on each segment, each with a single long black seta with a droplet at the tip. l2 is purplish brown with black conical spines, each with -10 dark setae

 two subspecies are found in cascadia; a. m. erinna is found in extreme s bc, in ne and se vva,  and in the cascades, ochocos, wallowas, and blue  mts of or. argynnis mormonia erinna flies in moist alpine and subalpine meadows, also drier hillsides, from -2,400 to 7,000 ft (warren, 2005). the single brood flies from late june to mid sep but is most common during july-aug. boggs (1987), studying a co population of a. mormonia, found males emerge 2-3 weeks before females and mate more than once
  females mate only once and do not appear to undergo reproductive diapause
 dispersal is limited, and males patrol for females
 mated females spend much time crawling through ground vegetation looking for oviposition sites
 fecundity is directly related to adult nutrition (boggs and ross, 1993). both sexes nectar on flowers, including asters, yarrow, and pearly everlasting; males and older females also visit mud, carrion, and animal scat
 larval hosts in cascadia include viola palustris (marsh violet), v. adunca (blue violet), v. nephrophylla (northern bog violet), v. nuttalli (nuttall's violet), and v. sempervirens (evergreen violet) (pyle, 2002; warren, 2005; miller and hammond, 2007). eggs are laid singly on or near senescing violets
  immature stage biology we reared or partially reared this species from females collected in pend oreille co., wa and wallowa co.,  or during aug. oviposition occurred immediately when females were provided with dried foliage of v labradorica (labrador violet) in plastic boxes  with muslin lids (32 x 20 x 9 cm). eggs were hidden underneath foliage and also laid on living foliage when provided
 eggs hatched after 10 days at 21-25 c, and li sought refuge in curled leaves without feeding on eggshells or leaves
 1.1 were overwintered at 5 c from sep 24 for 109 days with -9090 survival
 feeding commenced on v adunca, v labradorica, and v. odorala (sweet violet) after 5 days at 20-25 c, 12-15 hr light, and development from l2 to pupation took 68 days
 pupae held at 17-21c eclosed in 22 days
 larvae fed on young leaves at first, then older leaves, eating from the edges mostly at night
 l1-l3 tend to rest and feed communally in captivity
 l2-l6 possess an eversible ventral gland on segment 1 that produces a musky odor when the larva is disturbed (james, 2008a) and is likely defensive
 mature larvae silk together leaves as pupation tents, and pupation occurs close to the ground
 if hanging leaves are not available, larvae gather leaves and silk them onto a substrate to form a tent
 larval defense is based  on concealment (nocturnal feeding, pupa), chemical protection (ventral gland, setal droplets in li), and physical protection (spines).  description of immature stages the broad-based conical egg is creamy white turning orange-brown with indistinct red spots
 utere are 24-26 prominent vertical ribs merging to -12 at the top. li is medium-dark brown, with 8-10 prominent black bullae across each segment
 each bulla sports a long dark seta with a droplet at the tip. l2 is black with a wide white stripe dorsally, bisected by a thin brown line

 in our rearings, a. m. erinna l3-l6 were lighter and had more extensive white markings laterally than a. nt. washingtonia
 tlie dorsal white stripe was also more prominent and the overall appearance of late instars resembled that of a. atlantis
 l2ornfield (1980) described the larva of a. m. erinna in or as paler than other argynnis spp., but rearing of this subspecies from other locations (e.g., high-elevation habitats in or) is needed to determine whether lighter coloration is diagnostic in separating erinna from wiis/ungfou/u.  l5 @ 18 mm  l6 @ 32 mm  o  3 o 3  01 -r  vc  to v: 3 3  5'  2 o t  2 o 3  s ftj t  3 3 3  q.  o)  a in  l6 @ 32 mm    252 life histories of cascadia butterflies  mormon fritillary argynnis mormonia washingtonia (barnes & mcdunnough)  adult biology argynnis mormonia ranges from ak s to az and e to  mb, sd, ut, and co, occupying mid-high-elevation habitats
 two subspecies that differ substantially as adults occur in cascadia
 argynnis mormonia washingtonia is found in s bc and in the cascades of wa (pyle, 2002) and flies in moist alpine and subalpine meadows, also drier hillsides, from -2,500  to 7,000 ft. the single brood flies from early june to mid-oct but is most common during july-aug. females mate only once and do not appear to undergo reproductive diapause
 dispersal is limited, and males patrol for females
 mated females spend much time crawling through ground vegetation looking for oviposition sites
 both sexes nectar on flowers,  including asters, yarrow, and pearly everlasting; males and older females also visit mud, carrion, and animal scat
 larval hosts include viola paiustris (marsh violet), v. adunca (blue violet), v. nephrophylla (northern bog violet), v nuttalli (nuttall's violet), and v sempervirens (evergreen violet) (pyle, 2002; warren, 2005; miller and hammond, 2007). eggs are laid singly on or near senescing violets
  immature stage biology we reared this species several times
 females obtained from yakima co., wa july 29-30 (2 years) oviposited immediately when provided with dried foliage of v. labradorica (labrador violet) in plastic boxes with muslin lids (32 x 20 x 9 cm). eggs were hidden underneath foliage and also laid on living foliage when provided
 eggs hatched after 10 days at 21-25 c, and li sought refuge in curled leaves without feeding on eggshells or leaves
 li held at 21-25 c, 30-40% rh for 5-10 weeks before overwintering suffered 95- 100% mortality, but limited exposure (7 days) resulted  in <516 mortality
 li were overwintered at 5 c for 88 days with -9016 survival
 feeding commenced on v adunca, v labradorica, and v odorata (sweet violet) after 2 days at 27 c, 12- 15 hr light
 development from 1.2 to pupation took 44 days
 pupae held at 17-21 c eclosed in 18 days
 larvae fed on young leaves at first, then older leaves, eating from the edges and mostly at night
 1.1-1.3 tend to rest and feed communally in captivity
 1.2-1.6 possess an eversible ventral gland on segment 1 that produces a musky odor when the larva is disturbed (james, 2008a) and is likely defensive
 mature larvae silk together leaves as pupation tents, and pupation occurs close to the ground
 if hanging leaves are not available, larvae gather leaves and silk them to a substrate to form a tent
 prepupae that fall to the ground are able to pupate successfully
 larval defense is based on concealment (nocturnal feeding, pupa), chemical protection (ventral gland, setal droplets in 1.1), and physical protection (spines).  description of immature stages the conical egg is creamy white becoming brown with indistinct red spots prior to hatching

 we found the larvae of a. in. washingtonia were darker and did not have the extensive white lateral  markings of a. m. eriniur, however, coloration and markings may vary with habitat and geography, and more rearing is needed to confirm this difference
 the need for sufficiently humid conditions (>70%) to ensure good survival of pre-overwintering, diapausing 1.1 likely reflects adaptation to the moist habitats occupied by a. in. washiiu^toniii

 it is circumboreal, occurring in europe and asia
 in north america it occurs in ak and much of canada, s into n us, and along the rocky mts to nm. the preferred habitats are bogs, fens, and moist riparian areas between 1,300 and 3,600 ft and it is locally common in some areas
 the flight period in cascadia is mid-april-early sep with 2 broods
 guppy and shepard (2001) reported an apparent partial third brood in early sep in s bc. the larval food plants include viola palustris (marsh violet), v. nephrophylla (northern bog violet), and v. glabella (stream violet). males patrol conspicuously over grassy, boggy areas near violets, searching for females
 after mating, females remain concealed in the vegetation
 in captivity, oviposition occurs on host leaves or inert surfaces
 on aug 15 in pend oreille co., wa, we saw a second-brood female ovipositing on a hard edge of an unsurfaced road; viola was present a few hundred feet away
 a population of b. selene at moxee bog, yakima co., wa (pyle, 2002) may have been extirpated, possibly because removal of livestock allowed unbrowsed vegetation to choke out the viola
 scott (1992) reported the extinction of a small population in co, when horse grazing was stopped
 the survival of b. selene appears dependent on herbivore grazing in at least some situations
  immature stage biology we reared this species 3 times from gravid females from the first and second broods
 on june 24,4 females  from mary ann creek, okanogan co., wa, produced -50 eggs
 larvae provided with viola glabella and v.  scinpcrvircns preferred v. glabella
 thirteen larvae  reached l2, 10 pupating and producing adults
 females from tiger meadows, pend oreille co., wa, on july 1 and aug 28 produced -100 eggs during 5 days
 eggs hatched in 5-6 days at 21-25 c, and  larvae were provided with v glabella, v labradorica (labrador violet), and v' trieolor (pansy), which they accepted equally
 development from li to pupation took 25-30 (first brood) or 30-34 days, with eclosion  after 10-20 days
 guppy and shepard (2001) reported that some larvae in the first brood in bg develop very slowly
 some (3010) of our july 1 first brood became dormant in l3 despite long daylengths
 autumn- reared larvae were exposed to naturally declining daylengths, and development ceased in l2. a subgroup was transferred to 26-30 g and continuous lighting and immediately recommenced feeding
 overwintering is reported to occur as l2-l4 (scott, 1986a). larvae feed nocturnally on violet leaves, with early instars feeding on the undersides (scott, 1986a). l3-l5 eat large holes from the edges inward
 there are 5 instars, and no nests are made
 l2-l5 possess a ventral gland on segment 1 that secretes chemicals likely used to repel predators
 tlie survival strategy employs diurnal concealment, protective spines, and chemical defense
  description of immature stages the egg is whitish turning straw yellow with -18 vertical ribs crossed by 22-24 lesser horizontal ribs, creating a cancellate pattern
 li is marbled rusty, cream, and greenish
 ttiere are paired dorsal brown patches on the 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th segments
 all segments bear 8-12 shiny black bullae, giving rise dorsally to long black simple setae and laterally to pale yellowish setae
 the bullae in 1.2 are raised into itlack cones in uniform rows, each bulla bearing a cluster of dark setae
 the body is streaked longitudinally in a pattern of alternating dark and light stripes
 in l3 the dark stripes are reduced, the black bullae contrast with lighter colors at their bases, and considerable orange suffusion occurs laterally and dorsolaterally
 ventrolaterally there is a broad blackish stripe and the head is shiny black with dark setae
 tjie 2 dorsal bullae on segment 1 are longer and point forward like spiny horns
 1.4 is a mottled jumble of gray, orange, and black, with gray dominating dorsally
 tlie horns on segment 1 are longer, and all bullae are black, bearing numerous setae
 l5 is purplish gray, mottled with numerous black splotches and yellow spinctike bullae bearing setae
 the anterior 3 segments are  subfamily heliconiinae | family nymphalidae 255  li (2) 2.0 mm  egg (s) 0.9 mm  pupa @15 mm  black, and the horns t)n the first segment are long and black with yellow bases
 the pupa is mottled brown, black, and reddish with spiny projections; there are 5 pairs of shiny cream-colored cones on the head and thorax
 the larcae of other boloria  spp. are similar; however, the contrasting cellow spines, long anterior horns, and black anterior segments of b. selene in l5 are diagnostic
 there are numerous published images of larvae, the most recent including allen (1997) and guppy and shepard (2001) (both with pupa images), and wagner (2003), allen et al. (2005), and neill (2007). all images agree with ours
  discussion  viola host plants grow very low, often under other vegetation where the crypticalh' colored, nocturnal larvae are very difficult to find, but eggs can be obtained from gravid females
 larvae mac- be fragile in li, but later instars are hardier and will accept a number of viola spp., including commercial pansy
 most eggs from first-brood females develop directly to adults, but some midstage larvae diapause
 all second-brood larx'ae overwinter as diapausing l2-l4. ttie environmental cues for inducing diapause in the second generation are unknown, but we suspect declining daylength to be important; we were able to avoid diapause bv exposing l2 to continuous light
 a proportion of the population may be obliged to diapause as larvae regardless of environmental conditions
 little is known of natural enemies; however, pvle (2002) found that ambush bugs prey on adults visiting flowers
 research is needed to clarify the relationship between the ecology and persistence of b. selene and grazing by herbivores

 e populations are often found in disturbed environments, but in the w the  habitat is restricted to mid-high-elevation meadows
 adults fly from late may to early july where violet host plants grow, particularly the favored viola canadensis (canada violet). males patrol all day. conspicuously searching for females where open forest areas adjoin grassy meadows and boggy streams
 females generally remain low in the vegetation
 during mating the pair alternately perches and flies in tandem, avoiding other patrolling males
 in mid to late june, females oviposit on or near host plants, in damp boggy areas or adjacent woodland meadows
 scott (1992) observed  a female landing on a non-host plant, crawling down to the base, and ovipositing on a dead grass blade
 on june 23 we collected a mating female, and 3 days later she laid 85 eggs
 the eggs were laid singly
 12 on live violets, the remainder on inert surfaces
 the  meadow fritillary is reported to be double- and even triple-brooded in more e and s areas (scott 1986a), larvae often produce a second brood of adults in  captivity, and pyle (2002) reported 2 generations in cascadia; however, records of second-brood adults  in wa appear to be lacking
 scott (1992) reared a single brood in co in which 19 adults eclosed but 23 larvae diapaused, producing adults after a period of dormancy
  immature stage biology we reared this species once
 eggs from gravid females obtained in okanogan co. hatched after 5-7  days, with li consuming eggshells belore feeding on viola glabclla (stream violet) leaves
 larvae matured quickly, eating holes in leaves from the edge inward
 feeding throughout development was mostly nocturnal, and larvae often wandered off host plants  to rest
 the larvae did not build nests and typically rested on inert surfaces or under cover
 larvae of b.  bellona are not gregarious but are tolerant of each other
 a cohort of 12 1.4 and 1.5 were transferred  to viola labradorica (labrador violet) and readily  accepted this commercially available violet species
 development from egg-hatch to pupation took -17-20 days, with adults eclosing 24-34 days post egg-hatch
 all captive larvae produced second- brood adults
 according to scott (1992). b. bellona overwinters as freshly molted (unled) 1.4. and it is likely that environmental and host-plant conditions experienced by 1.2-1.3 determine whether direct development or diapause occurs
 pyle (2002) reported that overwintering occurs in 1.3 or 1.4.  description of immature stages 'ihe pale greenish yellow egg bears 18-20 vertical ribs, and many small lateral cross-grooves
 1.1 has a shiny black head and many simple, long setae on the body and head
 the anterior 3 segments are creamy gray  with posterior segments alternately brown and gray
 in l2 there is a staggered row of about 8 small dark tubercles across each segment, each ot the tubercles giving rise to 2-3 simple setae; the body is cream, brown, and green
 in 1.3 the tubercles are cone shaped and black, each giving rise to 10-15 unbranched black spines
 the body is variegated in brown and cream, with a distinct dark brown lateral stripe and a broken  cream stripe above it. ihe head in this and all instars is shiny black, bearing numerous setae
 l4 is grayish, with 2-3 faint rings circling each segment between tubercles and the black side stripe
 1.5 is similar e.xcept  the ground color is magenta-gray, and the tubercles are black at the tip and pink at the base
 an additional white longitudinal stripe is present along the basal periphery
 the pupa is brownish gray and angular
 a vertical column of 3 strong v-shaped chevrons dominates the posterior end of the abdomen, and there are several reflective metallic spots
 larvae ot other boloria spp. are similar to b. bcllojia and are best separated by comparison ot images
 larvae of boloria cpithorc lack the well-defined side stripes and differ in details of the complex body mottling; also spine-bearing bullae are orange
 boloria sclenc often co-occurs with b. bellona and feeds on the same host  subfamily heliconiinae | family nymphalidae 257  eggs @1.0 mm l2 @ 3.1 mm  l3 @ 6 mm  li @ 1.7 mm  plants; however, mature larvae ot this species are solid black anteriorly, mottled grav posteriorlv
 with contrasting orange tubercles
 scott (1992) provided a description of the immature stages of b. bellona that agrees well with our images
 images of mature larvae shown by allen et. al. (2005) and wagner (2005) are similar to ours; however, the image of a mature larva from \v\' in allen (1997) differs in being brown with white markings and has a red-brown head
  discussion  the scarcity of b. bellona in cascadia presents a challenge for obtaining gravid females
 timing appears to be important, with newly mated females likely to provide the best chances of obtaining fertile eggs
 females hide in grass and shrubs, and walking through prime habitat to flush them into flight may assist in finding them
 once eggs are obtained
 b. bellona is relatively easy to rear as long as violet hosts are available
 commercially available v. labradorica and native v glabclla are excellent substitutes for canadensis
 ttie full host range in cascadia is unknown and deserves study
 it is difficult to find larvae as host plants are numerous, small, and typically well hidden under taller grasses and shrubs; also the larvae are nocturnal feeders and likely spend daylight hours in protected refugia
 very little is known of the biology and ecology of this species, including the biotic and abiotic factors affecting abundance and distribution in cascadia

 this species is locally abundant and is found w of the cascades throughout cascadia and along the e slopes as well
 it also occurs in the mountains of ne wa, and in the blue and  wallowa mts of se wa and ne or. beyond cascadia it ranges from sw yt and sw ab, s through bc, mt, wa, id, wy, and or to central ca. larval host plants are violets including viola adunca (blue violet), v. glabella (stream violet), and v. scmpervirens (evergreen violet); warren (2005) and shapiro and manolis (2007) reported v. ocellata is used in ca, and scott (19b6a) suggested that v. nephrophylla is also a likely host
 both sexes visit flowers, including pearly everlasting, asters, and thistles, and males patrol relentlessly in search of females
 in captivity, females lay eggs singly, mostly on inert surfaces but also on cut and living viola plants if provided
  immature stage biology we reared or partially reared this species 5 times, in all cases from eggs from captive females
 on july 27, 4 females from tuquala lk, kittitas co., wa, produced 45 eggs resulting in 31 overwintering l4, and on july 16 (different year, same locality), 3 females produced 20 eggs resulting in several overwintering l4, but none survived winter in either case
 two  females obtained july 31 near swauk pass, kittitas  co., produced many eggs; 21 l4 overwintered, with 3 achieving adulthood
 females obtained aug 1 from bear creek mt (yakima co., wa) laid numerous eggs on potted v. glabella resulting in 8 overwintering  1.4. three survived and molted to 1,5 but died before  pupation
 'ihree females from sawtooth ridge (columbia co., wa) on july 8 produced -100 eggs on potted v.glabella and \'. labradorica (labrador violet) resulting in 2 1.4 overwintering and producing adults
 eggs hatched in 4-7 days and development was rapid on v. glabella, 17-18 days from 1.1 to l4. l4 continued feeding for 3-4 days before wandering off the plant, finding shelter in dead leaves, and entering diapause, often in groups
 diapause was terminated after 3-8 months by exposure to warm (15-26 c) conditions
 feeding commenced in 2-6 days, and larvae molted to 1.5 after 7-24 days, with pupation occurring 10 days later
 delayed termination of overwintering resulted in faster postdiapause development, with pupation occurring within 9-12 days
 newly hatched larvae refused to feed on the commercial v. odorata  (sweet violet), fed poorly on v' labradorica, but fed readily on v. glabella and v. adiitica leaves, eating scalloped holes from the edges
 leaves were strongly preferred over flowers, and when not feeding the larvae rested on the undersides of leaves
 survival  was good until diapause, but overwintering mortality was substantial
 protection is based on concealment  (nocturnally active), a ventral gland, and spines to dissuade predators
 itere are 5 instars, and nests are not constructed
  description of immature stages the egg is white with 20-22 prominent vertical ribs at the base, merging to ~8-12 at the apex
 li is greenish gray with a shiny black setaceous head that persists throughout development
 ilie 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th segments are rusty colored dorsally; tiny dark tubercles on the body give rise to simple long pale setae that bear small droplets at the tips, 'llie body darkens in l2 to purplish with indistinct gray markings
 tlie black bullae are conical, organized into 3 longitudinal rows laterally, each bulla bearing a cluster of black spines
 dorsally there is a broken narrow purplish line bordered on each side with gray markings
 l3 patterns are similar, but the conical bullae are taller, and the setae borne by them are more numerous, imparting a spinier appearance
 ventrally there is more orangish coloration and the whitish-brown stripe is straight
 l4 is intermittently striped longitudinally in black, gray, or white with a ventrolateral orange stripe
 uie conical spines on segments 1-3 are black, but others are half orange

 the wing cases are darker brown, and dorsally the abdomen hears 2 rows of  bold triangular processes that join on posterit>r segments to form forward-pointing chevrons
 immature stages of b. epithore are most similar to other bo/onvi spp. the larvae of b. tislarte, b. freija, and b. chariclea are usually considerably darker, and those of b. seleiie ha\e long horns over the head
 mature b. belhma larvae are browner than b.  epithore and have a distinctive black and white side stripe
 our images appear to be the first published of immature stages of b. epithore
  discussion  eggs are easily obtained from gravid females, and larvae grow quickly, overwintering in 1.4. rearing larvae under long or increasing daylengths mav avert winter diapause
 mortality during winter diapause was considerable in our roarings, sometimes complete
 high relative humiditv appears to be important for survival of diapausing larvae; however, excessive humiditc' causes mold problems
 dormant 1.4 should be aged for -10 davs prior to overwintering, postdiapause development is enhanced by prolonged overwintering (at least 6 months). larvae are difficult to find as they feed nocturnally on low-growing violets under other vegetation
 late-season (high-elevation) larvae tend to be present after most violet hosts have senesced, an apparent maladaptive strategy unless other hosts are also used
 research is needed on the identity and impact of natural enemies influencing the abundance and distribution of this species

 males patrol for females, flying erratically and close to the ground, sometimes even under low logs
 females are elusive but generally stay closer to host plants
 of 40 individuals seen near keremeos, bc on june 15-16, only 6 were female
 both sexes visit flowers, including bog rosemary, buttercups, asters, and yarrow as well as mud. larval hosts include vacciniwn caespitosum (dwarf bilberry), v. uliginosum (northern bilberry), r oxycoccus (wild cranberry), arctostaphylos uva-ursi (kinnikinnick), empetrum nigrum (black crowberry), rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), and rhododendron aureum (rhododendron) (pyle, 1981; scott, 1986a; nielsen, 1999; douglas and douglas, 2005). in cascadia, v. caespitosum and a. uva-ursi appear to be the major hosts
 eggs are laid singly or in small clusters on or near hosts (scott, 1992; douglas and douglas, 2005). we observed oviposition on the edge of a r caespitosum leaf in okanogan co.  immature stage biology we reared this species once from 6 females obtained on june 16 near keremeos, bc. confined in plastic and muslin cylinders (13 cm dia x 8 cm tall) with cut vaccinium parvifolium (red huckleberry) and a. uva-ursi, females laid -100 eggs in 2 days
 eggs hatched in 6 days at 20-22 c and li were provided with vaccinium scoparium (grouseberry) or v. caespitosum, reaching l2 after 4 days (july 1). l2 and l3 occupied ~8 days each with l4 reached by july 16. feeding continued for 10-14 days then ceased, with larvae measuring -23-25 mm. thereafter larvae  rested on the host or inert surfaces, not seeking refuge
 larvae shrank to 20-23 mm, and on aug 10, 9 larvae were placed at 5 c for overwintering, followed by a second group of 22 on aug 17. the second cohort was examined 35 days later, and only 4 larvae were alive
 these were exposed to 25 c and long days (-15 hr), but all died after 3-61 days without feeding
 one larva from the first cohort was exposed to warm conditions after 128 days but died after 71 days without feeding
 tlie first cohort was examined alter 215 days (mar 13); the 5 remaining larvae were exposed to 19-23 c and supplied with new and old growth of a. uva-ursi
 the larvae did not feed except for 1, which nibbled on a new growth leaf alter 4-6 days the larvae molted to 1.5 that did not feed; alter 1-3 days (depending on temperature: 22-28 c) they pupated
 adults eclosed after 10-12 days at 19-21 c. scott (1986a) and pyle (2002) stated b. freija overwinters as a mature 1.4, while nielsen (1999) and douglas and douglas (2005) suggested overwintering may occur as a pupa
 larvae fed on young leaves at first, then older leaves, eating from the edges
 larvae are solitary with no nests and most feeding is nocturnal, with larvae resting exposed on the host during the day. larvae are active when disturbed and rapidly move away from any threat
 1.2-1,5 possess an eversible ventral gland on segment 1 (james, 2008a) that is likely defensive
 prepupal larvae wandered before pupating from cage tops
 larval defense appears based on chemical protection (ventral gland, droplets on setae in li), physical protection (spines), and evasive activity
  description of immature stages ttie shiny greenish white egg has -35-45 shallow vertical ribs that amalgamate at the apex
 li has a shiny black setaceous head and is inconspicuously banded, gray and dark brown, becoming purplish with maturity
 tliere are 8-10 black bullae across each segment, each bearing a long dark seta with a droplet at the tip. l2 is black, developing gray areas with maturity
 six prominent conical black spines traverse each segment, each bearing -12-14 setae
 mature 1.2 have an indistinct pale spiracular stripe and the prolegs are white
 1.3 is black with black spines, a shiny black head, and whitish tan prolegs
 l4 is similar, unicolored black with distinct tan prolegs
 numerous tiny black bullae (-200 per segment), each bearing a short seta, give the body a textured appearance
 l5 is black with greatly reduced green spines giving the appearance of a green-dotted black larva with tiny light-colored bullae
 some individuals have pale dorsolateral stripes

 the black 1,4 and green- dotted black 1.5 of b. freija are imicine in our fauna and should not be confused with other boloriti  or argynnis spp. larvae of the related wieeiiiiiiiii- feeding b. chariclca are closest in appearance, hut mature larvae are speckled with white dots and have dull orange spines
 an image of an apparent l4 is shown in nielsen (1999) and appears similar to ours
  l2 @ 6 mm  l3 @ 1 5 mm  discussion  our rearing appears to be the first documented in north america
 eggs were readily obtained, and larvae fed well on v. scoparium and \ '. caespitosum, completing development to 1.4 rapidlv under mild temperatures
 larvae are black in all instars, optimizing available warming
 overwintering occurred as mature 1.4. the absence of feeding in postdiapause l4 and a brief 1.3 is highly unusual and possibly unic]uc. if post-hibernation feeding does not occur in wild populations, the need for l5 is puzzling; perhaps the species is evoktng toward 4 instars? attempts to break dormancv early were unsuccessful, with 1.4 remaining alive for lengthy periods without pupation
 between 4 and 7 months of cold temperatures appear necessary to break diapause; thus shorter winters may reduce overwintering survival
 studies on the overwintering and postwintering behavior of b freija are needed to better understand the ecology of this species, which may be vulnerable to global climate change

 males hill-top or patrol in search of females, often flying diagonally up and down slopes
 females eclose later than males and are more sedentary, basking on boulders or visiting nectar sources, especially arnica spp. saxifraga bronchialis (spotted saxifrage) is the only known host plant in cascadia, although s. tricuspidata (three-toothed saxifrage) is used in n bc (guppy and shepard, 2001). boloria astarte is biennial, requiring 2 years for larval development and flying on even-numbered years in cascadia; guppy and shepard (2001) reported similar flights in the coast range of bc, with flights every year (2 separate biennial populations) in the rockies
 oviposition occurs in mid-late july, with eggs laid on or near the host plant (scott, 1986a). captive females laid -85% of their eggs on inert surfaces, the remainder well hidden on the undersides of host  leaves very close to or touching the ground
  immature stage biology we reared this species once from 3 females collected july 21 at slate peak, okanogan co., wa. of 150 eggs laid, 80% hatched after 8 days with eggshells not consumed
 larvae were reared in 2 cohorts  on saxifraga bronchialis at 20-26 c and natural daylengths
 pyle (2002) reported that b. astarte overwinters as li the first winter and l4 the second  winter; however, in our rearing, larvae developed  from 1.1-l4 in the first season, taking -28 days; many (~30';b) of the larvae did not develop beyond l2-l3 and died before overwintering
 in mid-sep, l4 stopped feeding and sought shelter under paper toweling
 twelve 1.4 were t)verwintered at 5 c from sep 17. small groups (1-3) were removed from overwintering on dec 16, jan 3, f'eb 9, and march 13 and exposed to warm temperatures
 ihe l)ec group exposed to 19-21 c and natural daylengths remained dormant, but the jan group (/; = 2) started feeding after 9 days at 28 c in continuous lighting and molted to 1.3 2 days later
 1.5 fed avidly and pupated on the host plant ~2() days after exposure to warm temperatures
 one adult eclosed -12 days later
 tlie larvae removed from overwintering in feb died; those in march molted to 1.5, but after extended periods  of feeding, wandering, and resting, they also died without pupating
 our rearing suggests that in some instances larvae may develop to adulthood in 1 year if they avoid early-instar dormanc)', which, contrary to guppy and shepard (2001), does not appear to be obligate in at least a portion of the population
 larvae refused to feed on a number of plants, including viola glabclla (stream violet), arctostaphylos uva- ursi (kinnikinnick), and vaccininin caespitosuin (dwarf bilberry), confirming saxifraga spp. as the sole host
 larvae tolerated each other well in crowded conditions, with no evidence ot cannibalism
 tlte  larvae fed first on terminal leaf clusters, then the middle parts of leaves several tiers below the tip. protection is based on camouflage, concealment, and likely chemical defense from setal droplets in li and a ventral gland on segment 1 in l2-l5. no nests are constructed, and there are 5 instars
  description of immature stages the pale yellow-orangish egg is densely covered in -40 coarse vertical ribs at midheight, merging to -20 near the apex
 1.1 is pale tan-brown with a shiny black setaceous head, persisting until pupation
 each segment has a transverse row of about 10 low, round, brown bullae, each bearing a medium-length brown seta with a tiny droplet at the tip. 1.2 is purplish gray and the bullae are tall conical grayish spines, each bearing 8-10 dark setae, 'there are 3 dark broken dorsal lines and an irregular dark line laterally
 in l3 the dark lines expand, t'orming a mottled blackish ground color, while the pale markings constrict and form complex contrasting patterns
 1,4 is black with contrasting gray-white dorsal markings in complex but regular patterns ot dashes and vs. all spines and setae are black, the bases of the 2 dorsal rows circled  ll (o* 2.2 mm egg @1.1 mm  pupa @15 mm  in yellow-gold late in the instar
 1,5 is similar, with the bases of all spines encircled in gold, contrasting strongly against the black bod>- color
 f.ach spine bears -25 black setae
 white markings are also strongly contrasting, and dorsalh they meet at segment joints to torm patterns resembling caricatures of white butterflies
  bite spots pepper the body laterally and the spiracles are black, narrowly encircled in while
 ihe pupa is shinv dark brown on the wing cases and mottled dark and light brown elsewhere
 there is a lairly deep depression behind the thorax, and the abdomen bears rows of low rounded bullae
 most other boloria spp. iar\ ae are lighter; one exception is b. jrcija in which the larvae are even darker; however, the patterns are different
 no other boloria spp. use saxifraga spp. as hosts
 tire gold spine bases and prominent white markings of b. astarte are unique and readilv identify mature larvae
 gur images appear to be the first published of b. astarte immature stages
  discussion  immature stages of b. astarte are dithcult to find, and females are elusive and difficult to catch
 females appear to oviposit tor -1 week so timing is important, as is exposure to full sun. additional rearing is needed to determine the lite historv of this species, particularly concerning overwintering and the environmental cues determining biennialism
 nothing is known of the natural enemies affecting populations of b. astarte, nor ot climatic tolerances
 the restricted alpine habitat of b. astarte suggests vulnerability to climatic warming (miller and hammond, 2007), but further research is needed
 warmer summers might enable an annual rather than a biennial life cycle, but warmer winters might increase the mortality ot larvae

  in north america it is found in most of canada, mn,  and nh in e us and ak through the rockies s to nm in the w. in cascadia it occurs in bc and the  olympic and cascade mts of wa. boloria chariclea flies in a single brood in moist mountain meadows and alpine tundra (4,000-8,000 ft), mid-jun-sep, depending on elevation and seasonal conditions
 the life cycle is annual or biennial, according to latitude and/or elevation (pyle, 1981; scott, 1986a, 1992), but pyle (2002) considered it annual in cascadia
 it is locally common and often flies with b. epilhore
 both sexes visit flowers, especially asters and goldenrod
 males patrol for females usually during the middle of the day, when courtship and mating most frequently occur
 scott (1986a) observed a female that appeared to be releasing pheromone from 2 everted red glands at the end of her abdomen
 an unusually wide range of host plants have been recorded including viola spp. (violets), salix spp. (willows), vaccinium spp. (blueberries), polygonum bistortoides (western bistort), and dryas integrifolia (entireleaf mountain avens) (pyle, 1981; scott, 1986a; guppy and shepard, 2001). eggs are laid singly on the undersides of host- plant leaves or in the vicinity of hosts
 pyle (2002) observed oviposition on leutkea sp. (partridgefoot) in the olympics, and we observed oviposition on vaccinium deliciosum in s bc and the cascades
  at chinook pass (wa) we observed oviposition on lupinus sp. scott (1992) listed a large number of ovipositions and plant association records from co and showed that vaccinium was by far the most favored plant genus
  3  a  immature stage biology we partially reared this species from gravid females several times
 five females obtained aug 13 at twin lks, whatcom co., wa produced 40 eggs; 25 larvae overwintered, 10 surviving to spring at 4 c. placed at 20-22 c on april 23, they began feeding within 1 day on viola glabclla
 'i'wo survived to 9 mm (l3) after 20 days, but then ceased feeding and slowly died
 one female collected aug 12 at slate peak, okanogan co., wa produced 30 eggs, most of which hatched
 following overwintering, small groups of larvae were moved to 22 c on 5 occasions between april 7 and june 11 and provided with 7 different food plants, including red huckleberry, scouler's willow, pacific willow, commercial blueberry
 stream violet, bitter dock, and sheep sorrel
 in spite of these many variations, the larvae failed to feed and all died in li. females obtained on july 27, 29, 30, aug 6,7 from bear creek mt (yakima co., wa), chinook pass, and apex mt (bc) laid 30-400 eggs on each occasion
 confined in plastic boxes with muslin lids (30 x 23 x 12 cm) with senescing host plants ( viola spp., vaccinium spp.) and exposed to sunshine at 22-28 c, they laid eggs on leaves, twigs, and inert surfaces
 eggs hatched in 6-10 days at 22-27 c; larvae consumed their eggshells but fed minimally or not at all; 1.1 sought shelter in curled leaves and under debris, and hibernated
 dormant li held at 21-27 c, 30-40% rh for 4-6 weeks desiccated and sultered >90% mortality (2 cohorts). dormant li transferred to winter conditions (5 c, 75-85% rh) within 7-10 days of hatching survived better, with <50% mortality in 3 cohorts
 after 89-192 days, li were transferred to 21-27 c, 16 or 24 hrs of daylight, and provided with viola labradorica (labrador violet), viola odorata (sweet violet), vaccinium parvijoliiim (red huckleberry), or vaccinium scoparium (grouseberry). two cohorts (apex mt, chinook pass) fed well on both vaccinium spp. and poorly on viola, while the third (apex mt) fed well on viola and poorly on vaccinium
 feeding commenced after 3-5 days, and 1.4 was reached after -30 days
 in some instances 1.4 stopped feeding and reentered diapause
 mortality was high, e.specially in 1.1, and no larvae reached 1.5. larvae were reared mostly on leaf platforms on moist cotton wool and were prone to drowning and disease
 larvae reared under drier conditions suffered from desiccation
 protection appears to be based on concealment (larvae appear to be nocturnal), a ventral gland, and spines to dissuade predators
 there are 5 instars, and no nests are constructed
  subfamily heliconiinae i family nymphalidae 265  egg @ 0.8 mm  description of immature stages the pale yellowish white egg, orange at maturity, is broadly oval, wider at the base, with -30-35 vertical ribs merging tt) -20 at the apex and terminating around the micropyle
 1.1 is jirownish gray with a small sclerotized black collar
 the shinv black head bears setae and remains this way until pupation
 ttiere are 8-10 shiny dark tubercles i>n each segtnent, each bearing a single long pale seta, sometimes with a droplet at the tip. 1.2 is blackish gray with a broad middorsal pale stripe
 on each segment there are 6 conical black bullae, each with 10-15 spines
 in some individuals there are indistinct lateral pale markings
 1.3 is similar but blacker and with more profuse spines, tliere is an indistinct middorsal pale stripe bisected bv a black line
 in some individuals there are pale areas laterally
 uie true legs are black and the prolegs are white
 l4 is darker and spinier with some (.>rangish and white freckles laterally, particulark- at bullae bases, and has indistinct middorsal striping
 the head is distinctly bifurcated and brownish dorsallv
 mature larvae were described by scott (1986a) and douglas and douglas (2005) as gray with black dorsal and lateral stripes with orange spines, the fi rst subdorsal pair longer and yellow
 immature stages of other boloria spp. are similar; howex'er, larvae of b. chariclea are generally darker and less prominently marked than other boloria spp. our images are the first published of immature stages of this species in north america
  discussion although eggs are readily obtained from gravid females and unfed 1.1 overwinter well, rearing early instars of this species is challenging
 ll are very susceptible to disease, and it is difficult to obtain development to 1.2. later instars are hardier
 populations of b. chariclea appear to differ in host-plant preferences
 scott (1992) showed that vaccinium was chosen most often by ovipositing females in co; however, several of our larval cohorts preferred viola to vaccinium
 host-plant choice, larval utilization of hosts, and incidence of biennialism in cascadia are fertile fields for studv
