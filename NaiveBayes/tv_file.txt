Non-Habitat	"Parnaro naso naso was apparently collected by J.A. de Gaye on Silhouette in the early 1900s. However, Fletcher (1910 page 296) states ""Mr. de Gaye's collection contains numerous examples of Lepidoptera collected by him in Mauritius. I am inclined to question the true origin of this particular specimen, and this species must be queried as a Seychelles butterfly, pending further evidence."" Evans (1937) also lists a single female from Mahe (as Parnaro marchalii marchalii, an earlier synonym of P. naso naso). However, this taxon is endemic to Mauritius, and as no confirmed specimen has been collected in Seychelles, it is not considered part of the Seychelles fauna. "
Non-Habitat	"This butterfly is found in the Malagasy subregion. Its distribution includes Madagascar and Seychelles, where it has been recorded on Cosmoledo Atoll. It was incorrectly listed as occurring on the granitic islands in previously published works (Lawrence 2010). This butterfly appears to have a sporadic distribution within Seychelles, most likely represented by vagrants from Madagascar. This taxon has been erroneously listed as occurring on Reunion (Legrand 1965) and Mauritius (Williams 2007). Although unconfirmed, arbogastes may also occur on Mayotte in the Comoros (Turlin 1995).

Non-Habitat	This butterfly is widespread throughout the Afrotropical and Oriental regions including the Indian Ocean islands. In Seychelles it is only recorded from Astove.

Non-Habitat	Annual numbers fluctuate biennially due to the fact that the larvae need two years to develop. The species is most abundant in oddly-numbered years.
Non-Habitat	" In someareas of Norway it is in decline and in Sweden is most prevalentin the south. It was found in Denmark south of Viborg in declining numbers until 1955. Now it has disappeared from the islands and is found only in E.Jylland and farther north. It hasincreased enormously in numbers since 1965 and during thepast few years has reached Vendsyssel. It is found in great numbers in small, isolated oak brush in Himmerland. Crataegi hasalways been known for having especially abundant years, butthis recent increase is a genuine expansion and signifiesa particularly rapid and exceptional advance among Danishbutterflies.; it can be extremely abundant."

Non-Habitat	The Heteropterinae is a small subfamily with a characteristic ‘hopping’ flight.
Non-Habitat	Males of many species patrol incessantly along roads and clearings and females entering the patrol areas are quickly mated. Both sexes come to flowers and continue to flutter their wings while the long probosces probe the flowers.
Non-Habitat	Most of the species are extremely fast on the wing. One species is strongly migratory.
Non-Habitat	"Pyrrhiades have a more measured, buzzing flight."
Non-Habitat	"Pyrrhochalcia have a more measured, buzzing flight."
Non-Habitat	The males frequently swoop down to mudpuddles. J. Ciha (pers. comm.) collected a male on the Atewa Range in October 2003 that came down to drink at a small stream inside deep forest where there was hardly space for it to fly; it landed slightly upstream and then ‘hopped’ gradually towards him with a few wing-beats at a time.
Non-Habitat	"Most species are active from almost dusk till dawn, flying extremely fast."
Non-Habitat	"Rarely flies spontaneously. Normally the Blue Policeman appears just as a quick blue flash, since the flight is extremely powerful."
Non-Habitat	"Both sexes usually fly in the canopy of intact forests, but the males come to water, often flying quite low down along rivers to find suitable puddling spots. Seeing a male swooping down from the canopy to a river, with the wings held two-thirds open without movement is a magnificent sight. In Okwangwo males were diving down to investigate the main Ikom-Obudu road, evidently believing it to be a river."
Non-Habitat	"Has a slow, deliberate flight."
Non-Habitat	"C. Olory caught dozens at two locations in Okwangwo (Butatong and Boggo) in late January and early February 1996, indicating an outbreak and a possible migration. In East Africa mass migrations are regularly seen, with more modest ones in southern Africa."
Non-Habitat	Alfred Jørgensen told me they flew high in a forested areas and were mainly caught when hilltopping.
Non-Habitat	"The male has a weaving flight that is slower than other swallowtails and justifies the vernacular name, flying handkerchief. The female has the slow measured flight of its model, Amauris niavius, and the dionysos form has the same flight."
Non-Habitat	Some migratory capacity seems indicated (as in C. libeon); it has been seen five km off the coast of Senegal coming to lights at a ship (R. de Jong pers. obs.). The flight is fast and powerful.
Non-Habitat	"The habits of the Two Pip Policeman do not differ from that of C. forestan, where C. forestan forestan has some migratory capacity indicated (as in C. libeon); it has been seen five km off the coast of Senegal coming to lights at a ship (R. de Jong pers. obs.). The flight of C. forestan forestan is fast and powerful."
Non-Habitat	"Slow, buzzing flight."
Non-Habitat	"The flight of the Pyrrhiades genus is slow and buzzing, and close to the flight of Pyrrhochalcia iphis."
Non-Habitat	"P. lucagus has a slow, hovering flight almost standing still in the air when investigating flowers, damp patches, and bird-droppings, all of which it is fond of. Dozens are sometimes seen flying slowly around flowering mango trees. This is quite different from the frenzied flight of the Coeliades."
Non-Habitat	"The flight is quite slow and buzzing, not at all like most of the large skippers, but navigation in dense forest appears to be precise."
Non-Habitat	"The flight is fast and winding, and is at its most impressive when the huge butterfly dives down from the canopy with the wings held quite still at an angle of 40°.  In Kakum the canopy can be overlooked from the old park headquarters, where it forms a kind of bowl with a diameter of 150 metres or so. Between 10.00 and 12.00 hrs of most days, two or three males used the bowl as a parade ground, swooping up and down, frequently engaging in spirited fights."
Non-Habitat	It is closely linked to the remaining dense forests where it flies fast in the canopy and is difficult to collect.
Non-Habitat	"Its behaviour is probably similar to that of K. johnstonii, but the flight is faster."
Non-Habitat	"This butterfly displayed by flying tight circles in clearings and along paths, at a less furious speed than K. hollandi. Every few minutes they landed on the underside of leaves half to one metre above the ground."
Non-Habitat	The flight is fast and weaving.
Non-Habitat	"The flight is extremely fast and close to the ground, but often broken for a rest under broad leaves."
Non-Habitat	"The behaviour is similar to that of P. chrapkowskoides, a subspecies (nurettini) of which has a flight that is fast and weaving."
Non-Habitat	"Both sexes patrol a territory between 10.00 and 12.00 hrs, usually a length of forest path or a part of forest without low vegetation, flying in tight loops of about five metres, one metre above the ground. The patrol flight appears less frenzied that that of the Celaenorrhinus, but that may just be an optical illusion because of the large size of the butterfly."
Non-Habitat	The flight is fast and they are mostly seen on the wing when the males fly furious display flights in clearings and along paths. Frenzied.
Non-Habitat	"The flight is fast and direct, usually between one and six metres above the ground and only occasionally in the canopy."
Non-Habitat	"The males have a strong hilltopping tendency and in the dry zone nearly every hilltop will have one, endlessly circling in the updraft and using little energy to stay airborne. Mass migrations have been observed on many occasions in eastern Africa."
Non-Habitat	Has a more persistent and faster flight than other members of the group. It begins to fly in the early morning and avoids the company of other swallowtails.
Non-Habitat	"They are usually seen wandering down forest paths with an effortless, but nonetheless quite fast, flight."
Non-Habitat	"The habits are the usual ones of this genus, where the flight is fast and frenzied and they are mostly seen on the wing when the males fly furious display flights in clearings and along paths."
Non-Habitat	"It is a fairly common forest butterfly, which more than any other swallowtail lives in the closed understory where it weaves along, twisting and turning to avoid the tangled growth. The females fly more slowly, adopting the slow flight of their Acraea models, not least when searching for host-plants."
Non-Habitat	My Ankasa female was flying relatively slowly.
Non-Habitat	The male has display flights early in the morning (08.00-09.00 hrs) furiously flying around an open display ground of about five metres circumference.
Non-Habitat	"The Mountain Mimetic Swallowtail is not uncommon in submontane forest at Gashaka-Gumpti and on the Obudu Plateau, where it weaves its way slowly through the tangled undergrowth."
Non-Habitat	Migratory tendencies. In 1968 my father saw a vast single-species migration in the Guinea savannah of Nigeria (somewhere near the present Abuja). I once saw more modest numbers as a major component of a mixed migration towards the northeast at Natitingou in Bénin (April 1978) (Larsen 1978).
Non-Habitat	The males are strong fliers.
Non-Habitat	"Schultze (1917) considers it the fastest of all Papilionidae. The highest number I have seen on a single day is five or six, mainly hurtling down tracks and rivers at furious speed."
Non-Habitat	Males furiously patrol an open area of about ten by ten metres in the early morning and are not stopped even by numerous attempts to capture them; they invariably come back to the same patrol pattern.
Non-Habitat	"The flight is higher above the ground than that of C. galenus, and because of its large size the flight seems slower."
Non-Habitat	"The flight is usually slow and, especially that of the female; when coming to flowers she is an excellent mimic of Amauris damocles."
Non-Habitat	"The flight resembles that of G. latreillianus, looking lazy but actually making good progress."
Non-Habitat	"The male is an aggressive perching butterfly, swooping down on other passing butterflies from a height of two or three metres and the flight is usually very fast. Adopts different modes of flight at different times."
Non-Habitat	"The flight is so fast and different from that of Tirumala petiverana that a mimetic relationship might seem unlikely, though when searching for host-plants and laying eggs the female is more convincing. It is a savannah butterfly that migrates (sometimes in large numbers) or wanders into open areas of the rainforest zone, but it may not be a permanent resident in the wettest localities, such as the Cross River area."
Non-Habitat	"When the species is numerous, three or four fighting pairs whirl around at furious speed."
Non-Habitat	For a week in late May 1967 this species was the most common member of a mixed migration flying through Lagos (Larsen 1968).
Non-Habitat	"Once in Bossematié, Côte d’Ivoire I saw three males battling at great speed in a small open space deep inside the forest, almost managing to stay in physical contact despite the speed, staying 1.5 metres above the ground."
Non-Habitat	The flight is slower and more sailing than that of G. policenes and – also because of the size difference – the two can often be told apart in flight.
Non-Habitat	Males are seen perching and flying about low inside the forest. When disturbed they fly up and settle under a leaf high up.
Non-Habitat	I once saw a male circling furiously around a clearing created by a fallen tree.
Non-Habitat	"This is a weak butterfly. It is local in western Nigeria, more widespread and common in the east, and in the Oban Hills common even in the gloomiest parts of the forest, flying through the undergrowth with its slow flight, hardly ever settling, except on flowers. Schultze (1920) said that: “… the small, fragile inhabitants of the semidarkness of the understory fly so slowly and so clumsily [soap-bubbles spring to mind] that they are easily caught in flight with the fingers [translated from the German by the author]."
Non-Habitat	"This is an unobtrusive little butterfly staying close to the ground, often settling on bare earth or on leaves."
Non-Habitat	The Ghana Elf flies higher above the ground than E. lugens and E. melania.
Non-Habitat	"One day in Nairobi at 13.30 hrs I watched two males fighting vigorously on a piece of lawn no more than twelve square metres; they flew at great speed between 25 and 75cm above the grass, rarely less than 15cm from each other, and after seven minutes one flew away while the other settled on a leaf in the middle of the fight arena."
Non-Habitat	In Africa the wet season forms are the ones that migrate (see Larsen 1992c).
Non-Habitat	"The species is strongly migratory and colonized the Canary Islands in the 1960s. The largest migration yet observed was in Botswana, where a conservative estimate was that at least 1.5 billion individuals crossed the country in an east-northeasterly direction in the course of 30 days during April and May 1991."
Non-Habitat	The Grey Elfin skips along low down in open areas of the savannah.
Non-Habitat	"The males patrol low down and at great speed in a straight line, occasionally stopping to feed from flowers."
Non-Habitat	"The flight is always low down, except for E. senegalensis, which feeds on Acacia-creepers and therefore flies higher."
Non-Habitat	"The flight is always low down, except for E. senegalensis, which feeds on Acacia-creepers and therefore flies higher."
Non-Habitat	"Here E. senegalensis shows a distinct tendency to fly higher, while E. hecabe stays low down ."
Non-Habitat	On the wing it may easily be confused with Eretis plistonicus.
Non-Habitat	"Migration, sometimes in large numbers, is frequent."
Non-Habitat	Males often engage in furious fights with neighbouring males.
Non-Habitat	"Though it might be described as a S. thecla with a yellow underside, S. bouvieri differs in staying much closer to the ground. Males perch and fight less than a metre above the ground."
Non-Habitat	"The flight is weak, often inside dense vegetation."
Non-Habitat	"Females spend much time searching for appropriate host plants, which for the forest species does not seem to be all that easy. They are then easily told apart from their presumed Mylothris models since they fly so much lower than these ever do."
Non-Habitat	"A few are persistent migrants, with B. aurota and B. creona sometimes moving in ""snow-storm"" numbers."
Non-Habitat	"A few are persistent migrants, with B. aurota and B. creona sometimes moving in ""snow-storm"" numbers."
Non-Habitat	"On sunny days males of some Belenois and Appias fly incessantly along forest roads in large numbers, mainly in the same direction, and usually in the company of Graphium policenes. I have never had the patience or time to study what happens at the end of the forest, but any flight in the opposite direction always seems to be much weaker."
Non-Habitat	"On sunny days males of some Belenois and Appias fly incessantly along forest roads in large numbers, mainly in the same direction, and usually in the company of Graphium policenes. I have never had the patience or time to study what happens at the end of the forest, but any flight in the opposite direction always seems to be much weaker."
Non-Habitat	The reason for the scarcity of the forest species is possibly that they fly high in the canopy.
Non-Habitat	"The flight is low down, fast, and direct. R. St. Leger (pers. comm.) once saw a huge migration, exclusively of this species, near Sokoto in Nigeria."
Non-Habitat	The flight ranges from ground level to the canopy.
Non-Habitat	"The flight ranges from ground level to the canopy, except for N. pharis, which is always low down, much like a giant Leptosia."
Non-Habitat	"The flight of the male is fast and ebullient, but the female spends her time weaving through the understory in search of host-plants. Small numbers participated in a mixed migration through Lagos in late May 1967 (Larsen 1968), but I have seen no other migration records."
Non-Habitat	"Since the species is somewhat migratory, it may build up occasional non-permanent populations. Considerable numbers of both sexes participated in a large mixed migration through Lagos in late May 1967 (Larsen 1968). The flight is ebullient and the blue male is a pretty sight when he flies along the forest edge or along a sunlit path."
Non-Habitat	"It usually stays low within forests, often looking more like a Leptosia than a Nepheronia, visiting low flowers in their company. The species is rarely seen more than a few metres from the forest floor, in contrast to the two forest species, which regularly stray up into the canopy."
Non-Habitat	"I saw about six Lucretia's Paradise Skippers ""treetopping"" on the Atewa Range in Ghana between 11.00 and 12.00 hrs. They flew at the edge of the forest in a road clearing some six metres above the ground, patrolling a fifteen-metre stretch and often quarrelling, occasionally perching for a brief period."
Non-Habitat	"The Vine Leaf Vagrant flies in savannah woodland, often inside the crowns of trees. The flight is quite powerful."
Non-Habitat	"The flight is fast and weaving, often several metres above the ground, and the species is restless, flying almost incessantly."
Non-Habitat	"Especially in windswept places, the butterflies fly amongst the tangled stems of this plant and may never leave the plant of their birth. However, they do wander – possibly even migrate – since every little isolated stand of Salvadora usually has a colony."
Non-Habitat	All are low-flying butterflies.
Non-Habitat	Common Grizzled Skippers fly about with a rapid flight low down.
Non-Habitat	"Shares habits with C. amata, where C. amata amata may be migratory."
Non-Habitat	"The habits of this butterfly are the same as for S. spio, where S. spio flies about with a rapid flight low down."
Non-Habitat	The flight is fast and always low down; both sexes often settle on the ground.
Non-Habitat	The flight is faster and higher than usual in the genus.
Non-Habitat	Spialia ploetzi tends to fly higher above the ground than the savannah species.
Non-Habitat	"This butterfly has a vigorous flight, higher above the ground than usual in the genus, and may cover long distances, frequently stopping to rest on bare ground. Some males are also reputed to hover 1.5 to 3m above the ground near host-plants as part of mate-location behaviour (Swart 1997)."
Non-Habitat	The flight of Heteropterinae tends to be bounding and relatively slow compared with the Hesperiinae.
Non-Habitat	"Members of this genus have a relatively slow flight for skippers, always low down."
Non-Habitat	Males often patrol a large area flying at great speed close to the ground.
Non-Habitat	"The Mountain Crimson Tip usually flies incessantly along the edges of the submontane forests, unless it stops to visit flowers."
Non-Habitat	Golden Sylphs fly slowly.
Non-Habitat	Usually swarms around stands of Cadaba. The butterfly is very alert and rarely stays at the same flower for long.

Non-Habitat	The flight of the Lepeletier's Sylph is a bounding one.
Non-Habitat	The flight is not as strong as that of C. antevippe but stronger than that of C. evagore.
Non-Habitat	"The Tiny Orange Tip regularly migrates south (to Cape Coast in Ghana, and to Enugu and Okwangwo in Nigeria). In Morocco this frail butterfly regularly migrates up to elevations of 2,000m in the Atlas Mountains."
Non-Habitat	"The two West African species both have a bounding flight that is different from that of A. stellata Mabille, 1891 in coastal East Africa."
Non-Habitat	"Has a different flight from the two West African species of this genus, which have a bounding flight."
Non-Habitat	"The flight of the Yellow Hopper is a bounding one, rather slow by skipper standards."
Non-Habitat	"The flight is a series of rather weak bounds, rarely high above the grass, and often inside the tall grasses."
Non-Habitat	The flight is light and dancing.
Non-Habitat	"The flight is more powerful and higher above the ground than usual in the genus, often around Boscia-trees."
Non-Habitat	"Has a similar flight to Astictopterus abjecta, which flies in a series of rather weak bounds, rarely high above the grass, and often inside the tall grasses."
Non-Habitat	The species is a well-known migrant.
Non-Habitat	The flight of this species is weak and never much above the ground.
Non-Habitat	The species is migratory; it was part of a mixed migration in northern Bénin in April 1978 (Larsen 1978). On the wing it is similar to A. aurota.
Non-Habitat	The flight is rapid. Contrary to B. aurota and B. creona it is not strongly migratory.
Non-Habitat	"The Pale Ranger flies about rather leisurely in the shade of thickets, often resting on green leaves, then occasionally darting at great speed from one thicket to another."
Non-Habitat	It usually flies fast along the edges of the submontane forests.
Non-Habitat	"Significant numbers participated in a large mixed migration in Lagos in late May 1967 (Larsen 1968), but it is not usually an active migrant."
Non-Habitat	"In December 1996 males of the species were cascading by the thousands down every track and road in Okomu Nature Sanctuary in Nigeria, with smaller numbers of Appias sabina. Clouds of butterflies surrounded every spot where passing pedestrians or animals had urinated, stopping for a while before continuing their relentless flight. There was no return flight."
Non-Habitat	"The female is very similar to Mylothris rhodope. When seen in the dense forest she can be told apart by her checking of leaves rather low down when looking for host-plants, where the Mylothris are in the canopy looking for mistletoes."
Non-Habitat	"Single males are found sunspotting two metres or so above the ground inside high forest, occasionally making a quick investigative flight."
Non-Habitat	"I saw it a few times in Korup flying along forest roads – much faster than Mylothris flaviana, which tends to stay inside dark forest."
Non-Habitat	"Two of these are small butterflies that much resemble the small cabbage whites of the Holarctic Artogeia, Verity, 1947. The two others are larger with a more vigorous flight."
Non-Habitat	The flight is much slower and mostly higher above the ground than the Colotis.
Non-Habitat	"The males have a fast and somewhat weaving flight, different from that of the two smaller members of the genus. Small numbers participated in a mixed migration through Lagos in late May, 1967 (Larsen 1968), but no other migration records seem available."

Non-Habitat	Strong migrant.
Non-Habitat	"The flight is fast and furious, always low down."
Non-Habitat	"Several of the Indian Appias are regular large-scale seasonal migrants which during my childhood in the Nilgiri Mountains reached almost ""snowstorm"" proportions (Larsen 1978b). Three of the African species are known to migrate, with most records for A. epaphia, followed by A. sabina, but there seem to be no regular movements."

Non-Habitat	"Three of the African species are known to migrate, with most records for A. epaphia, followed by A. sabina, but there seem to be no regular movements."
Non-Habitat	"In December 1994 at Ankasa in Ghana large numbers of males were flying south down the old road together with Belenois theora and exiting the forest into mostly non-breeding territory (see under B. theora for a similar observation in Nigeria), but it did not have the character of a true migration. Small numbers participated in a large mixed migration in Lagos in late May 1967 (Larsen 1968), but this does not seem to a regular phenomenon."
Non-Habitat	"Small numbers participated in a large mixed migration in Lagos in late May 1967 (Larsen 1968). In December 1996 huge numbers of this butterfly spilled down paths and roads in Okomu, Nigeria with even more Belenois theora; hundreds stopped to drink from patches of urine. All flew in the same direction and there was no return flight during the three days I was there. Whether or not it was the beginning of a long-distance migration, I cannot say."

Non-Habitat	The adults of this species fly about with great speed.
Non-Habitat	"The males of this species perch about one metre above the ground and seem to need a large area in which to undertake furious display sorties from the perch. When this, the next, and some Osmodes are common a small clearing can be full of whizzing and fighting yellow and orange shapes."
Non-Habitat	"The Common Large Fox shares habits with R. galatia, where the flight characteristics of R. galatia are as follows: R. galatia males perch about one metre above the ground and seem to need a large area in which to undertake furious display sorties from the perch.

Non-Habitat	A. neander and A. gander are among the few skippers known to be migratory and may then appear in masses.
Non-Habitat	"Huge migrations of this butterfly are sometimes seen, though I have no records from west of the Dahomey Gap. Kielland (1990) observed a migration in Tanzania in February 1984, which lasted for two days and where the flight was “so thick that they reminded one of swarming bees."
Non-Habitat	"This species is migratory and fast flying. A migration of ‘A. neander’ was recorded from Calabar on 17 March 1986 from 17.20 for one hour with 400 m front with a speed of (at least) 43 kilometres an hour; the direction was from the north-northwest (Ried, Künzel, & Künzel 1986).

Non-Habitat	"All species of this genus are crepuscular, at which time males patrol furiously. Trimen wrote: “When in full chase they make a louder humming sound with their wings than most hawk-moths; I could often hear them a good ten yards off, when it was too dark to see them, except when they rose over the horizon."
Non-Habitat	"I once saw quite a few coming to the red flowers of a root parasite on a giant fig in deep forest at Boabeng-Fiema in Ghana at 08.30 hrs; their flight had a clearly audible buzzing sound, clearly announcing their presence."
Non-Habitat	"The habits of this rare species are presumably like those of other members of the genus, where all species of this genus are crepuscular, at which time males patrol furiously. Trimen wrote: “When in full chase they make a louder humming sound with their wings than most hawk-moths; I could often hear them a good ten yards off, when it was too dark to see them, except when they rose over the horizon.

Non-Habitat	This species is migratory.
Non-Habitat	"In the Aburi Botanical Gardens near Accra three or four males used to perch a metre or so from each other on a large bougainvillea facing a lawn, from where they would fly off on wild sorties, two or more often fighting. The speed of the large Borbo and Pelopidas must sometimes get close to 50 kilometres per hour."
Non-Habitat	This species generally stays low down.
Non-Habitat	"Gillies (1982) found this species just once in the Gambia, “flitting along emergent vegetation in the early morning along riverine swamps. The species is on the wing only when the grass is green and on home ground the males fly around the grass rather slowly, often settling with the wings held open in the typical Hesperiine manner, making a pleasing contrast in green and orange. They can fly as fast as the other Borbo if need be."
